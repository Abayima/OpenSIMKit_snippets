Open SIM Kit - Snippets
================================
Welcome to the OSK snippets and code dump repo. 

In this repo you can find all the ideas and small pieces of code that the OSK team are working on in our dream to build a set of ultra portable, cross platform tools for hacking SIM cards.

Each snippet should have some documentation with it in the README file, if not then have a look [here](http://dev.opensimkit.com/index.php/Dev_Snippets) on the dev wiki.

If you are looking for the main OSK project repo, its [here](https://github.com/Abayima/OpenSIMKit).
