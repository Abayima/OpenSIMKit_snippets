If you are more comfortable using traditional Makefiles, this is the
spot for you.  Simply find the Makefile you want to use in this
directory, modify it to your liking and change config.h to reflect the
behavior you want.  Then go into the src/ directory and symlink Makefile
from that directory to the one you chose in this one.
